              Traveling is something I love to do, and I was fortunate to be
              able to do a fair amount before the pandemic.

              While studying abroad in Hong Kong I was able to go around and
              spend time in the surrounding countries. This may sound strange
              but some of the best chinese food I've ever had was actually in
              Amsterdam. Being able to see the world is something I truely enjoy
              and I hope to be able to continue doing so soon.

              Music has also been a lifelong passion of mine. Learning to play
              drums at a young age to eventually picking up the bass, making and
              listening to music was always on my mind.
